# Remote-Controlled-Shell
## Basic remote controlled shell in Python 3.7

> This is a basic remote controlled shell made in Python 3.7 which isn't finished yet. I still have to improve the "cd" command and some others commands. The connections are managed by the so-called **socket** module and the commands are runned by the **popen()** method from the **os** module, so you can perform MS-DOS and UNIX commands (even on smartphones! (Because of their UNIX based kernel) /!\ which are equipped of a Python Interpreter).

> For the server, there are two dedicated words **"stop"** and **"close"** which allow the user to end the connection with the client.

## This project was made for fun and tests on my own-network, I'm not responsible of such malicious/ nasty use of it!
