# Remote-Controlled-Shell
## Basic remote controlled shell in Python 3.7

> This is a basic remote controlled shell that I made in Python 3.7, it isn't finished yet. I still have to improve the "cd" command and some others commands. The connections are managed by the **socket** module and the commands are runned by the **popen()** method from the **os** module, so you can perform commands MS-DOS and UNIX (even smartphones! (Because UNIX) /!\ which are equipped of a Python Interpreter).

# This project was made for fun and tests on my own-network, I'm not responsible of such malicious/ nasty use of it!
